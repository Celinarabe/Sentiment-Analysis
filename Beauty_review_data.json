just started getting into makeup sad i know lol im not a complete makeup buff because i feel as though i still dont need that much but i have come to be obsessed with eyeshadows lipstick and lip glosses when i saw these 120 colors my eyes lit up so many colors to choose from after ordering and counting down the days until im suppose to receive them and tracking my package lol the day finally came to receive them they were suppose to arrive this past saturday i waited 2 hours outside for the mailman i live in alabama and its hot here around this time of year the mailman didnt come and then it was a substitute mail carrier i called the post office and they said they deliver sometimes as late as 730pm i finally got  my mail had ordered something else off amazon that was coming at the same time as my eyeshadows and i got that package but no eyeshadows i called again and they said the mail carrier would come back to deliver it and that sometimes they dont realize there is more than one package i went back to my house and kept tracking my package here it was 750pm and it still said out for delivery the post office was closed at that time i was confused as to why it said it was still out for delivery 905pm came around and when i tracked my package again it said attempted delivery and a notice was left i was a little irritated but excited i checked the mailbox sunday and nothing not even a notice i was frustrated at this point i honestly thought since it was a female substitute that she took my eyeshadows i can laugh about it now but i was serious at the time lol monday came and i went to the post office with my id and tracking number in hand the post office worker went to the back to find my package then came back and said he couldnt find it i told him to check again because i know its back there he went to check again and sure enough he found it the box was definitely too big to fit in my mailbox the case could have fit perfect but not the package box it came in then he gave me another package i ordered something that was suppose to come tuesday and thought it came early i got in the car and tore open the box and stared in amazementat the paper it was wrapped in ive never seen wrapping paper like that before and it reminded me of my fishnet dress i own except my dress was white random observationmoving on well after unwrapping it from what seemed to be 3 boxes worth of paper i got to my eyeshadowscondition of product the case was beautiful and i love how you have to push the button to open it this means it will stay securely closed when i opened it my eyes carefully scanned over each eyeshadow color i then came upon the purple the purple was broken sad face but it was still usable then i counted and noticed that was only 60 colors i was looking around wondering where the other 60 was after inspecting the side i saw a little hole where your suppose to place your nail and lift up up under the shadows i was looking at was the other 60 all 60 of those were in perfect condition none of those were brokensurprise bonus ok im not sure what i did to deserve this next mention or if it was by accident but the other packagewas another 120 eyeshadows it was the same thing i ordered i checked my orders and sure enough i ordered only 1 set but they sent me a 2nd order of the same set i gave the 2nd set to my 15 and 17 year old cousins because they are just getting into makeup toowear a primer first i cant stress this enough  because if you want it to last longer and bring out the colors more use a eyeshadow primer first i use decrease eyeshadow base by loreal paris so far ive did a ombre green and that lasted me from 640am until i took it off around 7pm that night it still looked as though i just put it on when i went to take it off the next one i did was a pink hued smokey eye my boyfriend went crazy over that look on me lolheat warning even with a primer in humid conditions like here in alabama the shadows still creased my other shadows do it as well when its really humid maybe i need to apply more primer before putting it on in weather conditions like that but just a usual application of primer wont keep them from creasing if its very humid outside or your in a humid environmentover all im loving these colors there are so many different looks i can create from just the first 60 set of shadows just imagine how many can be created if you choose from the full 120side note when my cousins opened their set that i gave them all the shadows were in perfect conditionexcept the purple so it wasnt just mine im starting to think the purple breaks easily or it was the delivery to the post off i dont know but its still usable the purple in mine and theirs are just broken a littlefinal note these dont burn my eyes after wearing them for long hours my other eyeshadows tend to burn my eyes if i wear them for too long and to this day im not sure whybut these bh cosmetic eyeshadows dont hurt nor burn my eyes and thats a definite

over 50 these issues have accelerated  just lately within the last several months i have started experimenting with different oils as part of my beauty regime  my latest acquisition has been with avocado oil and i am very satisfied with all the resultsi had bought de la cruz olive oil first and i had received positive results as a facial moisturizer for my dry skin as a body moisturizer and as a hair treatment conditioner for my dry scalp and hair  one of the reasons why i chose de la cruz is because the two oils that i have ordered from them are 100 pure oil no additives parabens chemicals or anything else added to their productthis avocado oil has a very light scent but nothing that is distinguishable  yes it is oily but that is what the product isavocado oilas a facial product i have used the avocado oil in conjunction with my moisturizer oil first and followed by a moisturizer  for my skin the addition of avocado oil before applying the facial conditioner locks in the moisture  i only use about 3 or 4 drops to cover both my face and neck and within a couple of minutes my thirty skin absorbs the oil leaving skin both soft and supple  i have also used just 2 drops as a slight lubricant before my nightly derma rolling session  by minimally lubricating my face first with oil there is less irritation as the derma roller strips my face of the natural oils and i have better results less stinging less redness and i do not end the session as a dried out prune  after my derma session i apply my serums followed by the avocado oil i let it absorb for a moment or two and finish off by applying my moisturizer lastas body oil i apply it right after my shower before i towel dry  i receive the same results my skin is softer suppler and the avocado oil seems to retain the moisture better when i apply another body moisturizer on top  in other words my skin does not dry out as fastthere are many different ways to use avocado oil for a scalp and hair treatment i like to mix about 18 tsp in a handful of shampoo when i wash my thick course textured and dry color treated hair  the delivered results are a soft and manageable mane without any greasy or oily residue  instead of the usual dryness my hair retains the moisture until the next wash  for an intense hair and scalp treatment avocado oil is usually used in conjunction with other oils for these treatments  i have tried blending avocado with olive oil and received remarkably positive resultshair and scalp treatment1  blend tsp olive oil tsp avocado oil2  heat up slightlyi used a small glass covered jar for the blended oils and placed the jar in a bowl of very hotwater for about 1520 seconds3  then massage the heated oils in small circular motions directly into scalp and hair for 15 minutes  i have anissue regarding my fingers lockingup during these repetitive motions so i used a gentle shampoo  massagebrush the kent shampoo brush from amazon and this worked very well4  soak a soft towel in warm water and wring out  i used one of my soft toweling hair turbans for this part andwrap around hair for about 15 minutes letting the oils soak into the scalp and hair5  then wash thoroughly followed by usual hair conditioner6  blow dry or style as usualmy results  my hair rinsed out very well no greasy or oily residue and my normally dry hair was very soft and manageable  with the addition of a few spritzes of my argan oil my hair had both body and a little much needed volumeso far all the oils that i have used have provided my skin body and hair with very positive results as a moisturizer for all and as a detangle product and conditioner for my hair  however although i have received positive results each different oil has slightly different benefits so i will continue to use them all for a healthy varietythis concludes my review on avocado oil however if you wish to continue reading i have put together some facts regarding the benefits of avocado oilavocado oil skin benefitsavocados are an excellent source of omega3 fatty acids and vitamins a d and e and can provide skin with deep moisture  the oil of an avocado is able to penetrate the skin with its thin consistency and is still thick enough to serve as a protective barrier on the skin much like a lotionin addition to providing the skin with moisture the antioxidants found in avocado oil  particularly vitamins a and e  can help soothe sunburned skin  avocado oil also contains sterolins which are natural steroids  they may be effective in boosting collagen production and in treating age spots  with its high level of vitamin e avocado oil may reduce itching and inflammation of the skin and is beneficial in softening rough and cracked skinavocado oil hair and scalp benefitsavocado oil is full of hair vitamins that promote and maintain silky healthy and strong hair  it also contains amino acids that bind split ends nourish hair follicles and promote faster hair growth  the various nutrients in avocado oil protect hair from environmental pollution  apart from strengthening the hair strands avocado oil adds a dash of shine and makes hair super soft  in addition massaging the scalp with avocado oil regularly will immediately result in positive changes in hair quality  chemical treatments such as dyes and perms can also make the hair extremely dry and for this situation an application of avocado oil will deliver vitality to damaged hairthank you for reading my review and i hope it has been helpful in describing some of the uses and benefits for using avocado oil", "overall": 5.0, "summary":

over a year now  i have been using henna on my hair as well for over a year after it became so damaged from bleaching that it was breaking off like crazy so true henna will build up and darken on your hair with repeated use and it is a bch to get off because it fusesbonds itself with the hair  most people will just give up and cut it out  i loved henna and my red hair  my husband however despises red hair with a gutteral passionbad ex maybe who knows  he has harped and complained about how much he hates my hair on a daily basis and after a year it starts to wear on your nerves a bit  anyway my hair was getting darker and darker and i did want to lighten it up for summer  so i really didnt want to use bleach but i have tried all the natural remedies with no results whatsoever honey lemonade and olive oil treatments harsh shampooing  i found this in sallys beauty supply for about half the price it is here and got two packages  my hair is in good condition mid back thin to medium  two hours before using the bleach i saturated my hair with pure coconut oil and plastic wrapped it so the heat would help it penetrate  its a tip i learned on the internet that the girls said would help prevent my hair from breaking in the case i needed to bleach it more than once  it works i bleached my hair using a full beyond the zone bleach pack each time two days in a row and aside from being a bit frizzy and of course dry it didnt melt or damage it too much at all  it also does not inhibit the work of the bleach so just go for it after you have had the coconut on your hair for at least two hours more is fine then mix up your bleach and just put it right on top of your coconut oiled hair starting from the tips and working your way up  in case you are wondering if any oil will work they say the coconut works the best so stick with it anyway i left the bleach on my hair for 30 minutes the first day then rinsed and conditioned it air dry  day two 60 minutes  apply your bleach and put a plastic cap over it the heat helps it develop  be sure and do your coconut oil soak before each bleach just saturate it doesnt have to be dripping off  the first bleaching i did didnt lighten it a whole lot but day two lightened it up a lot  its not a banana yellow shade its more a greenishgold blond with a few red streaks here and there  after you rinse and lightly shampoo out the bleach i read that too much shampoovigorous will break the hair then apply a toner while its still wet  i used wella color charm mixed with a 20 vol developer and it will really tone out those crazy spots you get all over from different levels of bleach yellow roots white bangs red above the ears and brown hair below yikes  anyway hope this helps  my hair is not a gorgeous shade of blond i didnt expect it to be  but it is lighter most of the red is gone it didnt fall out and the husband is quietfinally no more ear beatings pupdate i tried putting another toner on it wella t14 which i think used to be silver lady and is now ash blond  now i know that putting ash blond would make the green worse but i did use it especially on the upper above the ears part of my hair that was still so red thisdid not work  i mixed it with a 20 developer for above the ears and a 10 developer for below the ears  it took out about 65 of the red so that my entire head had a more uniform shade of swampy yellow green now as appealing as that sounds i was almost in tears  my hair is too damaged to do much of anything more to it so as a last resort i found an old tube of henna king wild streaks in go go brown that i had from an old henna order  in desperation hoping that it would deposit some brown or something on my hair i mixed it in a bowl with enough conditioner to cover my whole head  i put enough of the wild streaks stuff in to make the color a dark brown almost coffee ground color  it was a thick muddy consistency but i smeared it in  after all how much worse can it get so i sat around looking like a muddy swamp monster for about 45 minutes hair uncovered i washed it out and hallelujah i can leave my house again without fear of being captured and sold to the circus anyway the color of my hair is unexpected  it did not turn it brown at all only softened the red and completely got rid of the green  my hair is a uniform color i would call it a ronald mcdonald orange or maybe vibrant psycho demented clown orange  i read somewhere that red color is a sort of filler for hair that has been damaged from bleach and i can honestly say that it works great on green so i used argan one and only in light chocolate brown with a level 10 developer problem solved or so i thought it came out a nice color washed out in only two shampoos with cool water and organic very gentle shampoo and gave me the worst headache ever i ended up using a demi permanent color ion warm red with a 10 developer  it worked well enough but still had a slight green hue especially after a wash  its still an improvement from before  lesson learned if you intend to henna realize that its very permanent  very permanent", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "what?!

{"reviewerID": "AHN86VFJIJ2JP", "asin": "B00GR4SSPW", "reviewerName": "Chicago Book Addict", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "ive been flat ironing my hair for over 12 years and in that time ive tried quite the assortment of hair straighteners from high to low end and from a variety of different brands cheaper hair straighteners have never quite compared as their life span never seems as long my hair seems more prone to drying out with use and often ergonomically they just arent as comfortable to use currently im using thets2 millennium professional flat iron though i also have theremington s7210 wet 2 straight flat iron with soy hydra complex 1 inchthat i keep in my gym locker for straightening on the go i was excited to try this out because i flat iron frequently about 6x a week so i am always looking for something that will get my hair even straighter and with less damage this straightener appealed to me because i had never heard about nano technology before and was hopeful it might lead to sleeker silkier healthier hairto be frank i just dont think this is the straightener for me using it has made me realize how much i enjoy my existing straightener the ts2 millennium professional flat iron so much more  the first thing i noticed about the panasonic is how big it is compared to my existing iron for some reason the picture makes it look much slimmer and sleeker than it is in real life  it feels very bulky compared to my existing straightener and it made it much less comfortable to use i have a lot of thick hair that falls just below my shoulders so it can take me a good 30 minutes to an hour to flat iron my whole head and i found that it felt uncomfortable to use it for that long and my hand was a little sore after a problem ive never experienced with my existing iron  the bulky shape also made it a little harder to maneuver and i definitely felt i couldnt be as nimble with this design wise i also like that on my ts2 iron the tip is designed such that it is easier to flat iron all the way to the roots  it is more rounded on the end and there is less of a gap between the end of the heated plate and the plastic iron  i really missed that feature on the panasonicawkward design aside the aspect i enjoyed least about this iron is the range of temperatures  i do like that you are able to control the temperature and i think the temperature read out looks very slick compared to other flat irons ive used  however the highest temperature 395 degrees f apparently isnt hot enough to flat iron my hair  when i was using this for the first time i couldnt figure out why this iron couldnt seem to get my hair as straight as the ts2 and why i seemed to need to go over each strand more times  then in comparing the irons i realized that the ts2 goes all the way up to 450 degrees f  apparently that extra 55 degrees makes a big difference for my hair if my hair wasnt so thick or long i wouldnt mind having to go over each section of hair more times but for me it makes my morning routine substantially longer  also i am trying to grow my hair out and my stylist has told me that my frequent flat ironing has slowed my hair growth and that i should really only be going over each section once and that is definitely not possible with this ironas far as the benefits from the nanoe i do feel like my hair is slightly softer when i use this product vs the ts2 but it is not a huge difference and it is hard for me to tell if that is really the result of nano or ironing my hair at a lower temperature this exercise made me realize im willing to sacrifice a little bit of softness in my hair in order to get it straighter and spend less time flat ironing ive also found that using a flat iron with good hair products helps a lot to combat the drynessthe other thing im curious to observe about this iron is its longevity  in my years of straightening my hair that has been one of the biggest differences between more expensive and less expensive irons  cheaper ones seem to die more quickly making them actually a more expensive proposition in the long runoverall i just havent been a fan of this iron  for my needs the ts2 has been a much better fit  however i think someone who typically flat irons their hair on a lower temperature and likes the feel of a larger iron would likely enjoy this more than i did however even for someone whose needs are different than my own im struggling to understand why this should command a price so much higher than reputable irons like chi which i have also owned in the past  the purchase price is more than ive ever spent on a flat iron in my 12 years of flat ironing my hair and while i am willing to spend more on hair styling tools that truly make a difference like my t3 hair dyer with this iron im failing to see a difference that commands a higher purchase price  its possible this is the kind of product where you will notice the effects more over time however because it just doesnt work for my needs i dont see myself using it regularly enough to realize thesei dont recommend this for long thick hair but it might be better for another hair type", "overall": 3.0, "summary":
